    <h1>Classic Buttermilk Waffles</h1>

    <p>This recipe is for a very typical plain waffle, crisp and golden, perfect with maple syrup and butter or berries and whipped cream. When made with pastry flour it will be extra crispy, and light as air inside. When made with all-purpose flour the waffle has a bit more body â€” still light, but chewier on the inside. The optional pecan meal or almond flour add a nice nutty flavor.</p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>397g buttermilk</li>
        <li>113g unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>210g all purpoe flour</li>
        <li>25g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl whisk together the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until nearly smooth; a few small lumps may remain.</li>
        <li>Spray your waffle iron with a non-stick cooking spray before preheating it. Cook waffles according to the manufacturer's directions. For an 8" round waffle iron, use about 1/3 cup batter; cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the iron stops steaming.</li>
    </ol>
